# Final submission for CVWO by Siah Wee Keat, Evan

The forum was built using Create React App using Typescript and the server was coded in Golang with a PostgreSQL database.

Before starting up the server, a database has to be created and "goose postrges {database url} up" must be entered in the terminal.



###Features of the app

The forum allows you to create posts and comments on your own or other people's posts. You are able to add a tag to your post to help with finding related posts. The posts can be filtered with the dropdown menu on the upper left of the navigation bar. 

You will only be able to edit and delete your posts and comments if they belonng to you and the edit and delete button should appear automatically. Otherwise, you should not see the buttons on other user's posts or comments. You can also choose to upvote a post and retract your upvote. 

Should a post be too long, it will be truncated but you are able to show the full body of the post by clicking on show more. 

Finally, you are able to delete your account which will remove all posts and comments created by the user. 

###Specifications and Reflection 

Having started with no experience, this was a daunting task. I had to learn the basics of Typescript and Golang and then learn how to use React before starting on implementing my app. I started learning using courses on Udemy but faced some difficulty in extracting the relevant details as courses were usually very general and covered a lot of different concepts. On the other hand, using youtube videos meant that I often had to search for the videos that were of a higher quality and the explanations were more thorough.
